#Replay Monitor


This is a tool for recording and observing data and measurements generated through the interactions between 
a reinforcement learning algorithm and an environment with an OpenAI Gym interface.

Currently, this tool offers two main features:
* An interactive tool that stores the interactions between the agent and the environment in a local DB and 
visualize it on-demand.

*  A convenient environment wrapper that allows the user to record Tensorboard metrics during the training of the 
RL agent.

To run the interactive tool use the following command in the command-line:
```
replay-monitor --db_path <db_path>
```
where `<db_path>` is the path to the .h5 file generated by the environment wrapper `Monitor`.
